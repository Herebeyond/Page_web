It is the Age of Unknowing. In the echo of Kosmo’s dream, all creation stirs. The world is but a whisper within the mind of a slumbering god, and reality is the shape of his imagination. As he dreams, so the planes exist — the physical, the divine, the magical — stitched together by thought. Yet, he is not alone beyond the dream.

From the depths of the Abyss, where logic dissolves and sensation reigns, came Chaos — the first-born of Kosmo, who tore a wound in dimensions for reasons long forgotten. From that wound, demons spill — not of flesh, but of miasma, thoughts, and un-being. Their presence cracks reality, warps causality, and twists reason. Even space itself bends where they walk. And yet even they tremble at the whisper of the Core — a realm deep into the wound, whose monstrous guardians could unmake gods.

In the Forgotten Worlds, magic is no mere tool, but a distorted dream, projected by a slumbering demon whose imagination shapes mana and spawns both wonders and horrors. It is a universe where boundaries between material and divine waver, dimensions clash, and beings born of nightmares haunt the fractures of existence.

Creatures older than the youngest of gods — titans, primordials, spirits, dragons, immortals, precursors, and void-bearers — roam the known realms as legends, some bearing curses that shatter fate, others worshipped by the desperate. Beneath the earth, dwarves of fire and stone shape mithril with bare hands in the mouths of volcanoes, while their kin in the deeps mine by feel and instinct, blind to light yet sensitive to the earth’s pulse.

Above, the sun warms the world — not by its heat, but by its gaze, for it is the eye of Qarios, second son of Kosmo, who with his sight shaped matter itself. The heavens are etched not with mere stars, but with constellations: living ideas, timeless, vast, and ever-present, beyond prayer and form. They bear the knowledge of past and future, granting it not for power, but to grow the truth of existence.

To live in this cosmos is to drown in wonder and terror alike. Death is no end but a passage — sometimes opened by necromancer, sometimes by divine hand. The undead walk, not always in defiance, but often in service. Champions, whether god-blessed or self-forged in will and fire, stand against unfathomable forces, delving into dungeons — shattered fragments of lost dimensions — where each step might unmake the mind.

In this dream, stars are eyes, constellations think, and thunder opens rifts. Darkness has mass, and the silence of the void is not absence but waiting. The divine is not benevolence. The demonic is not madness. And mortals are never merely mortal.

This is the sanctuary of what is seen, and the abyss of what is felt. A war between being and unbeing, between order and the hunger beneath it. A cosmos born from thought, unraveled by it, and what dares awaken within it.

In the Forgotten Worlds, nothing is simple. Nothing is stable. Every being, every thought, every breath is a battle against the erosion of time, chaos, and reason. And at the heart of this struggle, the only certainty is uncertainty: a universe of endless mysteries, where the search for meaning is the greatest war of all.

And the dreamer has yet to stir.
