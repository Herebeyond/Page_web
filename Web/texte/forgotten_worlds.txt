In the Forgotten Worlds, the fabric of reality is fragile, woven from whimsical laws where logic and chaos intertwine. Magic is not a mere tool, but a distorted dream, projected into the world by a slumbering demon whose imagination shapes mana and spawns both wonders and horrors. It is a universe where the boundaries between the material and the divine waver, dimensions clash, and creatures born of nightmares haunt the cracks of existence.

Dragons, once sovereigns of the skies, have adapted—forsaking their wings in the depths of forests to become drakes—while demons, beings born from the abyssal miasma, defy natural laws and bring disorder wherever they settle. Here, raw magic is an unstable force, fragile before the laws of physics, yet capable of overturning the heavens in an instant when wielded by bold mages.

Death itself is a blurred frontier. Skeletons walk under the influence of death gods, and liches embody spirits that rebel against their own fate. Yet even these powers must bow before older entities: the constellations, immutable and ever-present, gather all knowledge—past, present, and future—to guide the evolution of understanding.

Champions of this world, whether blessed by gods or self-made through will and fire, stand against unfathomable forces. They delve into dungeons—fragments of lost dimensions—where each step can shatter the mind. And always, in the shadows, the void’s magic whispers its infinite solitude, calling adventurous souls into the galactic unknown, where even the stars offer only a temporary reprieve from oblivion.

In the Forgotten Worlds, nothing is simple, nothing is stable. Every being, every thought, every breath is a struggle against the erosion of time, chaos, and logic itself. And at the heart of that struggle, the only certainty is uncertainty: a universe of endless mysteries, where the search for meaning is the greatest battle of all.
