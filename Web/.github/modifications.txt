### Category Management System Fixes - ENUM Database Integration

**Critical Fixes:**
- Fixed "Data truncated for column 'category'" SQL error by properly handling ENUM constraints
- Updated category system to work with database ENUM values instead of free-form text
- All categories now displayed (not just used ones) by reading ENUM definition from database schema
- Dynamic category validation that reads from database instead of hardcoded arrays

### Transaction Handling Fix - "There is no active transaction" Error

**Critical Bug Fix:**
- Fixed "There is no active transaction" error when modifying categories
- Removed nested transaction handling that caused rollback conflicts
- Simplified transaction management with single try-catch block per function
- Ensured proper transaction state checking before rollback operations

### Enhanced Transaction Management - Final Fix for Category Operations

**Critical Improvements:**
- Completely revamped transaction handling for category update and delete operations
- Fixed issue where database operations succeeded but errors were still displayed due to transaction warnings
- Implemented explicit autocommit control to prevent transaction state conflicts
- Added proper operation result checking before committing transactions
- Enhanced error handling with better separation of validation errors and database errors

### Final Transaction Fix - Removed Incompatible Transaction Logic

**Root Cause Identified:**
- MySQL ALTER TABLE statements cause implicit commits, making traditional transactions impossible
- Transaction rollback was failing because ALTER TABLE had already committed the transaction
- This caused "There is no active transaction" errors even when operations succeeded

**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed transaction logic from category update and delete operations
- ALTER TABLE operations cannot be rolled back anyway due to MySQL's DDL behavior
- Implemented step-by-step error handling without transaction dependencies
- Added proper error checking for each individual operation
- Enhanced error messages to provide better debugging information

### Dynamic Category Dropdown Updates - Fixed UI Synchronization

**Critical UI Fix:**
- Fixed issue where category dropdowns didn't update after successful category operations
- Category names were updated in database and category management modal but not in main interface dropdowns
- Hardcoded category options prevented real-time updates

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created dynamic category loading system with `loadCategoryOptions()` function
- Replaced all hardcoded category options with dynamic loading from database
- Added automatic refresh of all category dropdowns after successful category operations
- Implemented proper selection preservation during dropdown updates

**Technical Details:**
- Added `loadCategoryOptions()` function that fetches categories via `get_category_options` API endpoint
- Updates both main filter dropdown (`categoryFilter`) and idea form dropdown (`ideaCategory`)
- Preserves current user selections when refreshing dropdowns
- Added `formatCategoryName()` helper for proper display formatting
- Called refresh function after successful add, update, and delete category operations

**Files Modified:**
- **Ideas.php**: Added dynamic category loading system and removed hardcoded options
- **ideas_manager.php**: Uses existing `getCategoryOptions()` endpoint for dropdown updates

**Files Modified:**

1. **Ideas.php**
   - Added category management modal HTML structure
   - Implemented JavaScript functions for category operations:
     - openCategoryManagerModal() / closeCategoryManagerModal()
     - loadCategories() / displayCategories()
     - addNewCategory() / editCategory() / saveCategory() / deleteCategory()
     - cancelEditCategory() / showCategoryResult()
   - Added "Manage Categories" button to control panel
   - Enhanced interface for category management workflow

2. **PageStyle.css**
   - Added comprehensive styling for category management modal
   - Styled category list items with edit/delete actions
   - Added form styling for add category functionality
   - Implemented result message styling (success/error)
   - Enhanced button styling for different actions (edit, delete, save, cancel)

3. **ideas_manager.php**
   - **MAJOR UPDATE**: Complete rewrite of category management to work with ENUM constraints
   - Added new API endpoints for category management:
     - 'get_categories': Retrieves ALL possible categories from ENUM definition with usage counts
     - 'get_category_options': Simplified category list for form dropdowns
     - 'add_category': Adds new categories by modifying database ENUM structure
     - 'update_category': Safely renames categories by updating ENUM and migrating data
     - 'delete_category': Removes categories from ENUM after moving ideas to "Other"
   - Added getValidCategories() helper function for dynamic ENUM reading
   - Updated createIdea() and bulk import to use dynamic category validation
   - Implemented transaction-based operations for data integrity
   - Added proper error handling and validation
   - **SECURITY**: Added category name format validation (alphanumeric + underscores only)

**Key Features:**
- Safe category deletion (moves ideas to "Other" instead of orphaning)
- Real-time category usage count display for ALL possible categories
- In-place editing for category names with ENUM constraint respect
- Duplicate category name prevention
- Dynamic database schema modification for adding/removing categories
- Transaction-based updates for data consistency
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

**Technical Details:**
- Database ENUM column properly parsed and manipulated
- Categories are stored as: 'Magic_Systems','Creatures','Gods_Demons','Dimensions_Realms','Physics_Reality','Races_Beings','Items_Artifacts','Lore_History','Geography','Politics','Technology','Culture','Other'
- ALTER TABLE operations used to modify ENUM values safely
- Category name validation prevents SQL injection and formatting issues

**Data Safety Measures:**
- No ideas are ever orphaned when categories are deleted (moved to "Other")
- All category operations use database transactions
- Validation prevents duplicate category names
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- ENUM constraints prevent invalid category values
- Database schema changes are transaction-protected
