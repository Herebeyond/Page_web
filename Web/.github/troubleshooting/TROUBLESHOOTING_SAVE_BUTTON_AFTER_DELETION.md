# Troubleshooting: Save to Database Triggering After Point Deletion

## Problem Description
When deleting a point from the interactive map, the "Save to Database" button was still activating and showing as needing to save changes, even though deletions are automatically handled by the database and don't require additional saving.

## Root Cause
The issue was in two functions in `map_modif.php`:

1. **`removePointFromUI()` function**: Was calling `markAsUnsaved()` after removing a point
2. **`clearAllPoints()` function**: Was calling `markAsUnsaved()` after clearing local points

This was incorrect because:
- **Database points**: Already deleted from database via API call, no save needed
- **Local points**: Removed from local array, nothing to save to database

## Solution Applied

### File: `pages/map_modif.php`

#### removePointFromUI() function:
- **Before**: Called `markAsUnsaved()` after removing point from UI
- **After**: Removed the `markAsUnsaved()` call with explanatory comment

#### clearAllPoints() function:
- **Before**: Called `markAsUnsaved()` after clearing local points
- **After**: Removed the `markAsUnsaved()` call with explanatory comment

## Code Changes Made

### removePointFromUI() function (around line 861):
```javascript
// Before:
// Mark as unsaved
markAsUnsaved();

// After:
// Don't mark as unsaved for deletions - points are either already deleted from DB or were local-only
```

### clearAllPoints() function (around line 932):
```javascript
// Before:
// Mark as unsaved since we cleared local points
markAsUnsaved();

// After:  
// Don't mark as unsaved - clearing local points doesn't require saving
```

## Validation of Other markAsUnsaved() Calls
Verified that remaining `markAsUnsaved()` calls are appropriate:
- ✅ **Point dragging/moving**: Correctly marks as unsaved
- ✅ **Point editing**: Correctly marks as unsaved
- ✅ **Adding new points**: Correctly marks as unsaved

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Deleting a database point**: Point deleted from database immediately, no "Save to Database" prompt
2. **Deleting a local point**: Point removed from UI, no "Save to Database" prompt
3. **Clearing local points**: Local points removed, no "Save to Database" prompt
4. **Adding/editing points**: Still correctly triggers "Save to Database" when needed

## Testing Verification
- Create a new point → Should show "Save to Database" 
- Delete that point before saving → Should NOT show "Save to Database"
- Edit an existing point → Should show "Save to Database"
- Delete an existing point → Should NOT show "Save to Database"
