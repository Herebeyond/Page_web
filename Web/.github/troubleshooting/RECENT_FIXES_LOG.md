# Web Application Troubleshooting Log

## User Block/Unblock Security Issues

### Problem: Multiple Security & Database Issues in User Management
**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Files Affected**: `block_user.php`, `unblock_user.php`  

**Issues Found**:
1. **Database Connection Error**: `Expected type 'object'. Found 'null'` - PDO object might be null
2. **No Authentication**: Anyone could block/unblock users without login
3. **No Authorization**: No admin permission checks
4. **Self-Block Risk**: Admin could accidentally block themselves
5. **Missing Error Handling**: No validation that database connection exists

**Console Error**: `Expected type 'object'. Found 'null'` on `$pdo->prepare()` calls

**ROOT CAUSE**: 
- Scripts assumed `$pdo` would always be available from `db.php`
- No security checks for admin privileges
- Missing session validation
- No protection against self-blocking

### Solutions Applied:

**1. Added Authentication & Authorization**:
```php
// Added to both files
session_start();

// Check if user is logged in and is admin
if (!isset($_SESSION['user']) || !isset($_SESSION['user']['roles']) || !in_array('admin', $_SESSION['user']['roles'])) {
    echo json_encode([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => 'Access denied. Admin privileges required.'
    ]);
    exit;
}
```

**2. Added Database Connection Validation**:
```php
// Verify PDO connection exists
if (!isset($pdo) || $pdo === null) {
    echo json_encode([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => 'Database connection error'
    ]);
    exit;
}
```

**3. Added Self-Block Prevention** (block_user.php only):
```php
// Prevent admin from blocking themselves
if (isset($_SESSION['user']['id']) && $_SESSION['user']['id'] == $userId) {
    echo json_encode([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => 'Cannot block yourself'
    ]);
    exit;
}
```

**4. Enhanced Error Messages**:
- Clear access denied messages
- Specific database connection errors
- Self-blocking prevention message

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - User blocking now properly secured with admin authentication and database validation

## Map Point Edit Modal Issues

### Problem: Point Type Not Preloading & Missing Validation
**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Issues Found**:
1. Point type dropdown in edit modal was void (not showing selected type)
2. No validation to prevent adding/editing points without a type
3. Point edits only updated locally, not in database
4. No error handling - modal would close even on database errors

**Console Error**: Point type would reset to "Select type..." instead of showing current type

**ROOT CAUSE**: 
- `openMapPointEditModal()` was setting type value before dropdown options were loaded
- Missing type validation in both add and edit functions
- `saveMapPointEdit()` only updated local data, no database calls
- No error handling for database operations

### Solutions Applied:

**1. Fixed Type Preloading**:
```javascript
// OLD: Set value immediately (before options loaded)
document.getElementById('edit-map-poi-type').value = point.type || '';
loadMapEditPointTypes();

// NEW: Load options first, then set value
loadMapEditPointTypes().then(() => {
    document.getElementById('edit-map-poi-type').value = point.type || '';
});
```

**2. Added Type Validation**:
```javascript
// Added to both addMapPoint() and saveMapPointEdit()
if (!type) {
    showMessage('⚠️ Point type is required!', 'error');
    return;
}
```

**3. Added Database Update for Point Edits**:
```javascript
// Added database update in saveMapPointEdit()
if (mapPoint.database_id) {
    const response = await fetch('./scriptes/place_map_manager.php', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            action: 'update_point',
            point_id: mapPoint.database_id,
            name: newName,
            description: newDescription,
            type: newType,
            x: mapPoint.x,
            y: mapPoint.y
        })
    });
}
```

**4. Added Error Handling**:
```javascript
// Modal only closes on successful operations
try {
    // ... database operations ...
    closeMapPointEditModal(); // Only close on success
    showMessage('✅ Point updated successfully!', 'success');
} catch (error) {
    showMessage('❌ Connection error while updating point', 'error');
    // Modal stays open to preserve user's edits
}
```

**5. Enhanced Delete Function**:
- Added database deletion for saved points
- Proper error handling
- Only marks as unsaved for local points

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Point editing now works correctly with database persistence and proper validation

## PowerShell Command Issues

### Problem: && Operator Not Working
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Commands that FAILED**:
```powershell
# These commands failed in PowerShell:
find . -name "place_map_manager.php" && ls -la
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Name "place_map_manager.php" && Get-ChildItem -Path . -Name "*place_map_manager*"
```

**Error**: `The operator '&&' is reserved for future use.`

**ROOT CAUSE**: PowerShell doesn't use `&&` like bash/Linux. It has different operators.

### Solutions That WORKED:
```powershell
# Method 1: Use semicolon (;) for sequential commands
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Name "place_map_manager.php"; Get-ChildItem -Path . -Name "*place_map_manager*"

# Method 2: Run commands separately  
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Name "place_map_manager.php"
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Name "*place_map_manager*"

# Method 3: Use -and for conditional logic (different context)
# Only works in Where-Object contexts, not for command chaining
```

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Use `;` instead of `&&` in PowerShell

## Database Connection Issues

### Problem: Multiple Database Include Files
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Issue**: `place_detail.php` had duplicate database connections causing potential conflicts

**Files Affected**:
- `place_detail.php`: Had both `page_init.php` (which includes db.php) AND direct `require_once '../login/db.php'`
- `page_init.php`: Already includes database connection
- `login/db.php`: Main database connection file

**Solution**: Removed duplicate `require_once '../login/db.php'` from `place_detail.php`

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Single database connection path maintained

---

## File Structure Cleanup

### Problem: Duplicate place_map_manager.php Files
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Issue**: Two versions of `place_map_manager.php` found:
- `Web/scriptes/place_map_manager.php` (263 lines - outdated)
- `Web/pages/scriptes/place_map_manager.php` (449 lines - complete with image upload)

**Analysis**:
- Older version: Missing `change_map_image` functionality
- Newer version: Complete with error handling and image upload features

**Actions Taken**:
1. Kept the complete version in `Web/pages/scriptes/`
2. Deleted the outdated `Web/scriptes/` folder entirely
3. Updated FILE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md with changes

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Duplicate files cleaned up

---

## Map Point Edit Modal Issues

### Problem: Cannot Edit Points - Console Error "Cannot set properties of null"
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Issue**: Clicking on map points to edit them results in console error and no modal opening

**Error Message**:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML')
    at loadMapEditPointTypes (place_detail.php?id=9:1580:30)
    at openMapPointEditModal (place_detail.php?id=9:1498:9)
```

**Root Cause**: 
- `loadMapEditPointTypes()` function was incomplete (missing closing brace)
- `loadAvailableTypes()` was calling wrong endpoint (`map_save_points.php` instead of `place_map_manager.php`)
- Function had syntax errors causing script to break

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Fixed incomplete function**: Added proper closing brace and error handling to `loadMapEditPointTypes()`
2. **Fixed API endpoint**: Changed `loadAvailableTypes()` to call `place_map_manager.php`
3. **Added error handling**: Added null check for DOM elements before manipulation

**Files Modified**:
- `pages/place_detail.php`: Lines 1192-1208 - Fixed `loadMapEditPointTypes()` function
- `pages/place_detail.php`: Lines 1235-1250 - Fixed `loadAvailableTypes()` endpoint

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Point edit modal should now open correctly

---

## Map Point Movement Issues

### Problem: Point Coordinates Not Updated When Moving
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Issue**: When moving existing map points, the new coordinates weren't being saved to the database

**Root Cause**: 
- `saveMapPoints()` function only processed new points (without `database_id`)
- Existing points with `database_id` were skipped entirely
- Movement updates were lost even though frontend showed new positions

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `saveMapPoints()` to handle both new and existing points
- For existing points: Uses UPDATE query to save new coordinates
- For new points: Uses INSERT query as before
- Both scenarios now return `saved_points` data for frontend confirmation

**Files Modified**:
- `pages/scriptes/place_map_manager.php`: Lines 201-245 - Updated point saving logic

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Point movements now persist correctly

---

## Map Upload Path Issues

### Problem: Map Images Uploaded to Wrong Directory
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Issue**: When changing place maps, images were uploaded to `Web/pages/images/places/[place_name]/map/` instead of `Web/images/places/[place_name]/map/`

**Root Cause**: 
- `place_map_manager.php` is located in `Web/pages/scriptes/`
- Used relative path `../images/places/{$slug}/map` which resolves to `Web/pages/images/`
- Should have used `../../images/places/{$slug}/map` to reach `Web/images/`

**Solution Applied**:
- Changed path in `changeMapImage()` function from `../images/` to `../../images/`
- Frontend paths in `place_detail.php` already correct: `../images/places/{$slug}/map/`

**Files Modified**:
- `pages/scriptes/place_map_manager.php`: Line 335 - Fixed upload directory path

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Map uploads now go to correct directory

---

## IDE Static Analysis Warnings

### Problem: Red Underlines on $pdo Variables
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Issue**: IDE shows red underlines on `$pdo` usage in `page_init.php` and other files

**Root Cause**: 
- Static analyzers can't always trace variables across `require_once` statements
- The `$pdo` variable is initialized in `login/db.php` but IDE can't guarantee it's available
- If database connection fails, `db.php` calls `exit()`, so `$pdo` might not be set

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Added defensive check**: Added null check for `$pdo` in `page_init.php`
2. **Added PHPDoc comments**: Added `@global PDO $pdo` documentation to help IDE
3. **Fixed logical bug**: Added check for `$user` being false before using `$user['id']`

**Files Modified**:
- `page_init.php`: Added PDO null check and user existence validation
- Added PHPDoc comments explaining global variables

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Warnings remain but code is now more robust

---

## Summary

This log documents various PowerShell command issues and database connection problems encountered during the Web application development process. The main lessons learned:

1. **PowerShell Syntax**: Use `;` instead of `&&` for command chaining
2. **Individual Commands**: Sometimes it's better to run commands separately
3. **Database Connections**: Multi-host fallback pattern works well for Docker/local development
4. **File Structure**: Keep duplicates cleaned up and maintain clear folder organization
5. **IDE Warnings**: Static analyzers can't always trace variables across includes - add defensive checks

**Status**: All major issues documented and resolved.
